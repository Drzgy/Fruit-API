*Fruit API* is a universal deep reinforcement learning framework, which 
is designed meticulously to provide a friendly user interface. Specifically,
FruitAPI has the following noticeable contributions:


* Friendly: *Fruit API* follows a modular design combined with the OOP in Python
to provide a solid foundation and an easy-to-use user interface via a simplified 
API. Based on the design, our ultimate goal is to provide researchers a means to 
develop reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with little effort. In particular, 
it is possible to develop a new RL algorithm under 100 lines of code. What users 
need is to create a `Config`, a `Learner`, and plug them into the framework. We
also provides a lot of sample `Config`s and `Learner`s in a hierarchical structure
so that users can inherit a suitable one.
